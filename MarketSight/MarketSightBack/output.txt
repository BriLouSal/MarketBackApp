Wall Street analysts have set a price target range between $215.00 (low) and $345.00 (high), with an average target of $281.75 and a median of $280.00. This suggests potential upside of approximately 5.8% based on the mean target. The consensus recommendation from 41 analysts is "BUY" with a rating of 2.0, indicating strong confidence in the stock's prospects.

## Company Size and Revenue Performance

This company generates massive revenue of $416.16 billion annually, which translates to $27.84 in revenue per share. The company has shown modest revenue growth of 7.9%, indicating steady but not explosive expansion. This level of revenue growth is typical for a mature, large-cap company and suggests stable business operations rather than a high-growth phase.

## Profitability Metrics

The company demonstrates exceptional profitability across multiple measures. Gross margins stand at 46.91%, meaning nearly half of every dollar earned in sales remains after production costs—this indicates strong pricing power and efficient manufacturing. Operating margins of 31.65% show the company runs a tight ship operationally. Most impressively, net profit margins reach 26.92%, meaning over a quarter of all revenue converts to actual profit. The company generated $195.20 billion in gross profits and maintains an EBITDA of $144.75 billion with EBITDA margins of 34.78%, showcasing robust operational efficiency.

Return on Assets (ROA) sits at 22.96%, demonstrating the company extracts significant profits from its asset base. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) of 171.42% appears extraordinarily high, which is actually influenced by the company's capital structure and use of debt leverage—this isn't necessarily bad but indicates aggressive financial engineering through share buybacks and debt financing.

## Growth Trajectory

Earnings growth exploded at 91.2%,
